# Face-Landmark-Detection

# **Introduction**

Face Detection Systems have great uses in todayâ€™s world which demands security, accessibility or joy! Today, we will be building a model that can plot 15 key points on a face.

Face Landmark Detection models form various features we see in social media apps. The face filters you find on Instagram are a common use case. The algorithm aligns the mask on the image keeping the face landmarks as base points.

In this notebook, we'll develop a model which marks keypoints on a given image of a human face. We'll build a Convolutional Neural Network which takes an image and returns a array of keypoints.

We'll require a GPU Hardware accelerator for training the model. Change the runtime type to GPU by going to Tools > Change Runtime Type > Hardware Accelerator > GPU.
